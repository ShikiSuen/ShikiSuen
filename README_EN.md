------

- 🎼 I prefer using Steinberg Dorico Pro + Arne Wallander NotePerformer to do both my music engrave work and orchestral compositions. This combination is much efficient than using Sibelius / Finale.
- 💻 I can self-maintain computer hardware & software environments for audio production purposes. I can also maintain a Linux / FreeBSD host server for simple HTML-based websites and some PHP-MySQL forum installations.
